# Markerbot Website
A group project for year 10: The website and app behind a device to write using a pen/pencil in a style mimicking the user's handwriting

I wrote the app, and made some modifications to the website (& later reconstructed some of it after it was deleted), while other team members set up the initial website and wrote most of its contents.
