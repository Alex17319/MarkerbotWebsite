# Markerbot Website
A group project for year 10: The website and app behind a device to write using a pen/pencil in a style mimicking the user's handwriting

I wrote the app, and made some modifications to the website (& later reconstructed some of it after it was deleted), while other team members set up the initial website and wrote most of its contents.

To test the app, browse to 'App/\_Handwriting Samples' and copy the contents of one of the .txt files. Paste this into the import/export or import dialogs of either the style input or writing generator page, then on the writing generator page provide some text to be handwritten and click 'generate handwriting'.

To use the app in full, click the mode to select the desired quality, then write out each letter in your desired handwriting, with the grey letters in the background used only to see which letter should be written, rather than as a guide for how to draw it. As you go, drag the sliders to mark each letter's width (though leave some space - half the space you'd expect before the next letter should begin). Once you reach the double-letter combinations, the widths will be marked automatically - make sure your letters fit roughly within the space provided.  
As you go, feel free to click 'save to url' to save your progress, and then save the links or use the import/export dialog to save the data elsewhere (currently there's no way to erase letters, so taking backups may be valuable if you make mistakes). Once you're done, click 'save to url' and then 'generate handwriting' to switch to the writing generator page.

On the writing generator page, if no style is already imported (ie. the url just ends in 'WritingGenerator.html' rather than being followed by a bunch of other contents) import a style through the import box. Then type/paste some text to be handwritten, and click 'Generate Handwriting'. There are currently a number of bugs with the generation (and other parts of the app), and as this is no longer really an ongoing project I'm unlikely to fix them, but it's a workable demonstration.
